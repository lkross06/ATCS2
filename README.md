# Advanced Topics in Computer Science (repeat)

**School:** The Head-Royce School

**Term:** 2023/24 year

**Instructor:** Brian Sea

**Final Grade:** A

This hybrid course focused on cybersecurity and networks. Most of the back-end was written in Python, although HTML/CSS/Jinja2 was used for making static pages and templates. Being a repeatable course, the content is decided upon at the beginning of the year by the students. I retook this course during my senior year of high school.
